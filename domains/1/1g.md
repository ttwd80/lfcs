Archive, backup, compress, unpack, and uncompress files

- issue [#2](https://github.com/ttwd80/lfcs/issues/2) - not sure why there are some many operations, I think is should just be backup/restore/compress/uncompress.

Examples
1. Create tar archive - [TODO](https://github.com/ttwd80/lfcs/issues/3)
1. Compress tar file to create a tar.gz file - [TODO](https://github.com/ttwd80/lfcs/issues/4)
1. Decompress tar.gz file to create a tar file - [TODO](https://github.com/ttwd80/lfcs/issues/5)
1. Unpack a tar file - [TODO](https://github.com/ttwd80/lfcs/issues/6)
1. Create and compress in a single command - [TODO](https://github.com/ttwd80/lfcs/issues/7)
1. Uncompress and unpack in a single command - [TODO](https://github.com/ttwd80/lfcs/issues/8)
